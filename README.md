# OptiFleet

This project was made by me in around 24 hours on a hackathon [GreenHack](https://greenhack.eu).  
You can see this project in action on [zero.pavelkral.eu](https://zero.pavelkral.eu).

Purpose of this project is to make company car refresh based on historical data rather than assumptions.

This is me showing that I was working on this project til 1:36 AM on the hackathon ðŸ™‚
